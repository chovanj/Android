## How to install an official Samsung firmware back to your mobile
If you want to install an official Samsung firmware back to your mobile follow this guide.

1. Download the latest version of [Odin flash tool](http://odin3download.com/). See [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odin_(firmware_flashing_software)) if you want to know more about this tool.

2. Download an official version of Samsung firmware for your mobile. I used [Updato](http://updato.com/) webpage for downloading firmware. On the webpage you can search any firmware by device. For my Samsung Galaxy S3 i9300 I downloaded it from [ca3ffc731e7c11e6949e0cc47a44b7b2](http://updato.com/firmware-archive-select-model?record=CA3FFC731E7C11E6949E0CC47A44B7B2). I recommend backing it up because these sites are changing very quickly.

3. Enter download mode by following these steps.
- Power off your Samsung phone, press and hold Volume Down, Home and Power keys at the same time.
- Release all three buttons when Samsung phone reboot and you see a warning sign.
- Press Volume Up to enter the main screen of download mode.
